            <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
            <p>Volleyball is a big part of my life. Both me and my sister play so its been our main bonding activity. Volleyball has helped us grow closer and stay active and competitive. One of the biggest impacts volleyball has made on my life is helping me gain confidence in myself and have a growth mindset. The sport is 50% skill and 50% mental. If you don't believe that you can accomplish your goals, then you will never reach them. I also have to believe that there is always something to improve on. This helps me stay motivated to work and give 100% in everything I do.</p>

            <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Summit Shasta has offered an 8-week Computer Science course as one of the expeditions. After completing the first week of the course, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in gaming or anything that relates to computers. It is very helpful to see how websites are made and the basic markup language behind it. Taking this class has interested me in the new branch of computer science based jobs as well. 0100101001100001011100110110111101101110001000000110100101110011001000000110000100100000011011100110010101110010011001000000110100001010</p>
