    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">A motherboard is the main circuit of your computer and is what makes the entire thing run. It is made up of the CPU, ROM, memory RAM expansion slots, PCI slots, USB ports, plug for the power supply, and other controllers for devices such as the hard drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. On this page, I will be specifying on the CPU, memory RAM expansion slots, hard drive, power supply, and the keyboard, mouse, and monitor and their functions.</p>

    <p class="line">CPU is the abbreviation for Central Processing Unit. It is the primary component in the computer that processes instructions and functions of the computer. It runs the main operating system and applications and it constantly is receiving from the user or activated software programs.</p>

    <p class="line">RAM is the abbrieviation for Random Access Memory. It is made up of small memory chips that form a memory module which are inserted in the memory RAM expansion slots on the motherboard. Having an RAM allows users to store and access information in random locations within DRAM in the memory module. The RAM also requires power to access he stored information. Without power, the memory is lost.</p>

    <p class="line">The hard drive is the computer's main storage device that stores and retrieves digitial information using fast rotating disks coated in magnetic material. It permanently saves the data even when powered off. It is not attached to the motherboard, which means it has to be plugged in.</p>

    <p class="line">The power supply unit, also known as the PSU, converts the household power into a lower voltage direct current to power the internal parts of the computer. This component also has a socket on the motherboard that allows it to plugged in.</p>

    <dt>All of these devices have to be plugged into sockets on the motherboard. They are all placed in the same corner for easy access.</dt> <br>

    <p class="jay" style="margin-left:30px"><u>Keyboard</u>: The keyboard is an input device used to enter characters and functions into a computer by typing on the keys. Most keyboards have the "QWERTY" layout.</p>

    <h2><a name="communication">Different Components</a></h2>
    <p>The communication system that transfers data between all components in the computer and other computers is called a bus. It is made up of electrical and optical fiber wires and uses parallel and bit serial connections to function. On the motherboard, components communicate through the north and south bridges.</p> <br>

    <p class="jay" style="margin-left:30px;margin-bottom:100px"><u>Northbridge</u>: This bridge specifically connects the CPU and the RAM and allows data to be transferred between the two components. <br><br><br><br> <u>Southbridge</u>:This bridge, also known as the Input/Output Controller Hub, specifically connects the CPU and the PCI, SATA, USB ports, Ethernet ports, and the on-board audio. </p>
